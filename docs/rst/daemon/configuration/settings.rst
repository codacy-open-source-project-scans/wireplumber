Well-known Settings
===================

This section describes the settings that can be configured on WirePlumber.

Settings can be either configured statically in the configuration file
by setting them under the ``wireplumber.settings`` section, or they can be
configured dynamically at runtime by using metadata.

For more information on what "settings" are and how they work, refer to the
previous section: :ref:`config_configuration_option_types`.
